<h1>Resource updated</h1>
<p>In this case, the backend did not issue a redirect, so no history has been set
  and you can neither re-display this page if not re-submitting the form.</p>
<p>If you go back and then forward, the container won't be restored to
  the current state.</p>
<p>This approach is useful to perform small updates on the displayed content,
  e.g. to <code>like</code> it or to <code>subscribe</code> an user to subsequent
  content updates: classic RPC! :-)</p>
