<h1>Thanks, the form has been submitted and you have been redirected to this page.</h1>
<p>As you can see, the URI in the address bar has been updated and you can navigate back
  to the previously displayed page.</p>
<p>Moreover, navigating back and forth won't re-issue the POST request, thus preserving
  idempotence of GET requests.</p>
<p>This approach is useful e.g. to update a <code>Post</code> on the server and redirect
  the user to the <code>Post</code> detail page.</p>
